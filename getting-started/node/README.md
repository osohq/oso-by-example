# Anatomy of the sample application

The sample application comprises two routes: `/org` and `/repo`, for the `Organization` and `Repository` objects. Each
route accepts a path parameter corresponding to the object's ID; e.g., `/org/acme` is accessing the `acme`
`Organization`. Both routes accept `GET` and `POST` requests.

This sample application is integrated with Oso Cloud to provide enforcement on the routes. It is intended to serve as an
example, so please make changes to better resemble a more familiar domain!

## Starter policy

This application assumes the [starter policy](../starter_policy.polar) is active in your Oso Cloud environment.

# Running the sample application

Grab an API key from your Oso Cloud environment, and update the source code with your key:

```js
// remember to update this before running the server!
const apiKey = "<please provide your api key here>"
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Now you can run the webserver:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Making requests

To authorize requests, Oso needs to know which Actor is performing an action.

To keep the implementation of this sample application simple, all requests assume the actor is `User{"anonymous"}`.

```js
const oso = init({
  apiKey,
  defaultActorId: (_req) => "anonymous",
});
```

So, this request is authorized for the `User{"anonymous"}` actor:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/org/acme
```

You can use whatever HTTP client you like for these requests - for these examples, we'll be using `curl`.

# Configuring authorization data with facts

By default, all routes will return a 404 for all users. To get a successful 200 OK response, you'll need to add some **facts** to Oso Cloud.

## Assigning roles on an `Organization`

The `Organization` resource has two roles:

- the `viewer` role (which grants `view`), and
- the `owner` role (which grants both `view` and `edit`)

By assigning roles to an Actor as a fact, we can grant access. Roles are assigned to individual instances of a resource - in this case, we'll consider `Organization{"acme"}`.

### `GET /org/acme`

This route is enforced:

```js
oso.enforce({
  resourceId: ":org_id",
  action: "view",
  resourceType: "Organization",
})
```

To access this route, you'll need to provide the `view` permission. This can be accomplished by adding a fact, which gives `User{"anonymous"}` the `viewer` role:

- `has_role(User{"anonymous"}, "viewer", Organization{"acme"})`

Now, the following request should succeed:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/org/acme
```

### `POST /org/acme`

This route is enforced:

```js
oso.enforce({
  resourceId: ":org_id",
  action: "edit",
  resourceType: "Organization",
})
```

This time, instead of the `view` permission, you'll need to provide the `edit` permission.

This can be accomplished by adding a fact which gives `User{"anonymous"}` the `owner` role:

- `has_role(User{"anonymous"}, "owner", Organization{"acme"})`

Now, the following request should succeed:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/org/acme
```

(This route doesn't require a request body, it is just looking for a POST request.)

## Constructing a relation with facts

The resource block definition for `Repository` contains a relation, `repository_container`:

```polar
resource Repository {
  # ...
  relations = { repository_container: Organization };
  # ...
}
```

This allows **associating a Repository with an Organization**. We declare this with a fact, which references:

- a specific instance of a `Repository`, and
- a specific instance of an `Organization`.

For example, if we wanted to declare a relationship from `Repository{"code"}` to `Organization{"acme"}`, we could add
the following fact to Oso Cloud:

- `has_relation(Repository{"code"}, "repository_container", Organization{"acme"})`

This is relevant for a few permissions, defined on the `Repository` resource:

```polar
resource Repository {
  # ...
  "viewer" if "viewer" on "repository_container";
  "owner" if "owner" on "repository_container";
  # ...
}
```

Assuming we declared the relationship between `Repository{"code"}` and `Organization{"acme"}`, this means:

- if an actor has the `viewer` role on `Organization{"acme"}`, they will have the `viewer` role on `Repository{"code"}`
- if an actor has the `owner` role on `Organization{"acme"}`, they will have the `owner` role on `Repository{"code"}`

## `GET /repo/code`

This route is enforced:

```js
oso.enforce({
  resourceId: ":repo_id",
  action: "view",
  resourceType: "Repository",
})
```

To access this route, you'll need to provide the `view` permission.

We can grant access by assigning the `viewer` role to `User{"anonymous"}` on `Organization{"acme"}`:

- `has_role(User{"anonymous"}, "viewer", Organization{"acme"})`

Even though this fact does not reference `Repository{"code"}`, assuming the relation mentioned earlier is defined (`has_relation(Repository{"code"}, "repository_container", Organization{"acme"})`), our Polar policy declares that the `view` permission is inferred:

> if an actor has the `viewer` role on `Organization{"acme"}`, they will have the `viewer` role on `Repository{"code"}`

After adding these facts, the following request should succeed:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/repo/code
```

## `POST /repo/code`

This route is enforced:

```js
oso.enforce({
  resourceId: ":repo_id",
  action: "edit",
  resourceType: "Repository",
})
```

To access this route, you'll need to provide the `edit` permission.

We can grant access by assigning the `owner` role to `User{"anonymous"}` on `Organization{"acme"}`:

- `has_role(User{"anonymous"}, "owner", Organization{"acme"})`

Again, we're not referencing `Repository{"code"}`, but assuming the relation mentioned earlier is defined (`has_relation(Repository{"code"}, "repository_container", Organization{"acme"})`), the Polar policy declares that the `edit` permission is inferred:

> if an actor has the `owner` role on `Organization{"acme"}`, they will have the `owner` role on `Repository{"code"}`

After adding these facts, the following request should succeed:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/repo/code
```
